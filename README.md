practiceapp
===========
Practice is a new mobile/cross-platform app intended to help students create (and then execute) a practice plan when learning something they don’t currently know.  Often students wait until the night before something is due to work on it. (We’ve got the data.)  Practice is intended to be an anti-night-before-something-is-due app.  The goal of deliberately practicing something is to recall it quickly and with little effort.
